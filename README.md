# OL Geotiff drag and drop

**OL-GDnD** is an [Openlayers](https://openlayers.org/) mapping tool to allow Geotiff drag and drop imagery over the map. It helps user to view it on the fly, data remains on the user end. It is written in [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/) and uses Geotiff.js library [Geotiff.js](https://github.com/geotiffjs/geotiff.js/)(Library)

Demo
